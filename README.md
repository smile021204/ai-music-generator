# AI Music Generator

The AI Music Generator allows users to create unique music compositions by selecting from classical composers or POP style. The application runs online and can also be set up locally for development or personal use.

## Overview

This Flask-based web application dynamically generates music based on selected genres, including classical composers and modern pop. Utilising a trained model for each genre, the application can create complex duets by layering two melodies from the same or different genres, according to user preferences.

## Features

- **Genre Selection:** Users can select one or multiple genres to influence the generated music.
- **Custom Note Length:** Specify the number of notes for the generated melodies.
- **Adjustable Tempo:** Users can set the tempo of the output music. The specific information about the tempo can be found if clicks the * mark
- **Chaotic Level:** Control the level of chaos in the generated music. The specific information about the chaotic level can be found if clicks the * mark
- **Dynamic Music Generation:** Utilises pre-trained models for each genre to generate music on the fly.
- **Music Display:** Generated music is displayed in a standard music notation format.

## Technologies
### Frontend
- **HTML:** Structure of the web pages.
- **CSS:** Styling and layout of the web pages.
- **JavaScript:** Client-side interactivity and dynamic content.
### Backend
- **Python:** Backend logic and server-side processing.
- **Flask:** Web framework for Python.

## HTML Descriptions
- **index.html:** This is usually the main page of a web application. In your project, this page probably has the first user interface where users can choose their music generation preferences such as genre, tempo and level of chaos. It may also have instructions or an overview on how to use the app.
- **styleSelection.html:** This page is likely where users can choose the style (or genre) of music they want to be generated. With a name like that it might contain options or controls for users to give their preferred music style(s). Once a style has been selected, the application will generate music in that chosen style basing on this information.
- **OSMD_View.html:** This page is likely where the music score is displayed. It may contain the music score generated by the application. This page may also contain controls for users to play, pause, or stop the music. It may also contain options for users to download the music.

## Running the Application Locally

If you prefer to run the application on your own machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.11 (3.12 is not supported)
- pip (Python package installer)
- Flask
- music21

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   Open your terminal (or command prompt on Windows) and run the following command to clone the source code:
   ```
   git clone [https://github.com/smile021204/ai-music-generator.git]
   cd ai-music-generator
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   In the project directory, install the required Python packages using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**
   You can start the server using:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
   Replace `main.py` with the name of your Python script if it's different.

4. **Access the Application**
   Once the server is running, open a web browser and visit:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```
   This will bring up the AI Music Generator home page.

### Additional Configuration

- Make sure the paths in the application settings (like for music21) are correctly set for your local environment.
- Ensure all environment variables (if any) are configured properly.


## Troubleshooting

### Music Score Display Issues

When accessing the AI Music Generator for the first time, you may encounter an issue where the music score does not display properly. If this occurs, simply reload the webpage. This should resolve the display issue and allow the music score to appear correctly. This is known to occur occasionally due to the way resources are loaded and should only be a one-time inconvenience upon first load.

If the problem persists, please check your internet connection and browser console for any errors that might indicate what is going wrong.

### Running the Test Suite

When running the test_app.py and if it fails the test, main.py should be run once before running the test_app.py.
